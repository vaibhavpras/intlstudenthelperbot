        "Question": "How do I prepare for SAT?",
        "Answer": "For Reading and Writing, Erica Meltzer’s books (“The Critical Reader”) are the gold standard whereas for Maths, CollegePanda and UWorld (if you’re willing to dish out money) are very popular in the SAT community. \nIf you want more resources for the SAT, the subreddit r/SAT is a great place to start. Tutoring is not necessary to get a good score; however, if self-learning is not your cup of tea, a tutor might help."

        "Question": "What score do I need in SAT/ACT for a T20\Ivy?",
        "Answer": "This question is hard to give an answer to. Admission to these universities/colleges is known to be highly holistic; this means your acceptance is decided by a multitude of things, one of which is your SAT score. Therefore, there is no one answer since for example, if your ECs are very strong, they tend to make up for weak SAT scores. If you’re applying to a T20 school, SAT scores are usually more important than if you’re applying to LACs since LACs as a whole have a more holistic process. \n\nAlthough if you are an international needing aid, it is recommended to have a SAT score above 1500 just to be on the safe side of things.  However, having a SAT score above 1500 by no means guarantees acceptance just as having a SAT score below 1500 by no means guarantees a rejection. It is however not advisable to have an SAT score that’s very low (<1400). Make sure your SAT scores are at least above the 50th percentile from the college’s average SAT data of previous years, and 75th percentile to be safe."

        "Question": "Is my SAT/ACT score good enough for X university?",
        "Answer": "A good way to gauge how competitive you are for X university is to check what percentile your standardized scores fall into. However, admission is not assured even if you’re in a university’s 99th percentile since US admissions are “holistic”."

        "Question": "What score do I need on the TOEFL",
        "Answer": "Hey, a quick note on the TOEFL (and equivalents).  Most colleges only care that you can hit their minimum score.  These vary by college and range from Bowling Green at 59 to Oxford at 110 (out of 120). For some colleges, they like to see scores that are a bit above their stated minimum, but most will simply view this as a pass/fail criterion."
