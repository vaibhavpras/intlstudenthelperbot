        "Answer": "For Reading and Writing, Erica Meltzer’s books (“The Critical Reader”) are the gold standard whereas for Maths, CollegePanda and UWorld (if you’re willing to dish out money) are very popular in the SAT community. \nIf you want more resources for the SAT, the subreddit r/SAT is a great place to start. Tutoring is not necessary to get a good score; however, if self-learning is not your cup of tea, a tutor might help."

        "Question": "What is a good SAT/ACT score for a T20\Ivy?",
        "Answer": "This question is hard to give an answer to. Admission to these universities/colleges is known to be highly holistic; this means your acceptance is decided by a multitude of things, one of which is your SAT score. Therefore, there is no one answer since for example, if your ECs are very strong, they tend to make up for weak SAT scores. If you’re applying to a T20 school, SAT scores are usually more important than if you’re applying to LACs since LACs as a whole have a more holistic process. \n\nAlthough if you are an international needing aid, it is recommended to have a SAT score above 1500 just to be on the safe side of things.  However, having a SAT score above 1500 by no means guarantees acceptance just as having a SAT score below 1500 by no means guarantees a rejection. It is however not advisable to have an SAT score that’s very low (<1400). Make sure your SAT scores are at least above the 50th percentile from the college’s average SAT data of previous years, and 75th percentile to be safe."

        "Question": "Is my SAT/ACT score good enough for X university?",
        "Answer": "A good way to gauge how competitive you are for X university is to check what percentile your standardized scores fall into. However, admission is not assured even if you’re in a university’s 99th percentile since US admissions are “holistic”."

        "Question": "What is meant by an EFC?",
        "Answer": "Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is an index number that colleges use to determine how much financial aid you’re eligible to receive. Your EFC is calculated according to a formula established by law and the information from your College Scholarship Service Profile (CSS)."

    {
        "Question": "What score do I need on the TOEFL/IELTS",
        "Answer": "Most colleges only care that you can hit their minimum score.  These vary by college and range from Bowling Green at 59 to Oxford at 110 (out of 120). For some colleges, they like to see scores that are a bit above their stated minimum, but most will simply view this as a pass/fail criterion. The same goes for IELTS"

    {
        "Question": "Are my ECs good enough / What are good ECs?",
        "Answer": "Do we need Extracurriculars? Do they matter? \nExtracurriculars are extremely important and T20s and top LACs weigh them heavily. Make sure you try to show some form of leadership in any EC that you can. Remember: Having a spike in a few is far better than being a jack of all trades. However, if you can do your best in various ECs, that’s even better. \n\nWhat are considered ECs? \nECs are any activities you take outside the classroom. They could be community service, sports, helping your parents with chores or any other productive activity outside the classroom. \n\nWhat are good ECs? \nA lot of times when somebody asks this question, they’re trying to gauge which ECs will appeal to top schools and which ECs won’t. This is a bad idea as top schools care about authenticity and taking part in ECs for the sake of appealing to schools is never a good idea. Admissions officers at top schools have enough experience to see which activities you truly care about and which activities are there just to pad your resume. \n\nWith that being said, a good EC is anything you have put a lot of time and effort into. A good EC for one applicant could be playing table tennis at the national stage whereas a good EC for another applicant could be planting trees across their community or raising awareness about the pitfalls of poor education in their country. Once again, try to show initiative and leadership in your ECs if possible!"

        "Question": "How much money do we need to apply? Are there fee waivers? How to get them?",
        "Answer": "For the Common Application, you can easily get fee waivers for all 20 schools you are applying to. All you need is a signature from your counselor stating that the application fees pose a financial burden. \n\nHowever, the Coalition App won’t give you fee waivers if you’re an international student. If you do want fee waivers for the schools you’re applying to through the Coalition App, you need to email these schools directly and ask for a fee waiver."

    {
        "Question": "How to get CSS fee waivers?",
        "Answer": "You have to email each school and ask and not all schools give out CSS fee waivers for international students (and most of these schools accept the ISFAA). Some schools like Middlebury only give out fee waivers to international students whom they find competitive enough to genuinely consider for admission. "

    {
        "Question": "I cannot afford the cost of sending official test scores to colleges, What do I do?",
        "Answer": "The vast majority of schools allow you to self report your test scores (meaning you can enter your SAT/TOEFL/AP/SAT-SUB scores in Common/Coalition App and they will take these to be your official test scores). \n\nUnfortunately, some schools like Colgate University require official SAT scores to be sent directly from the College Board itself so for schools like these, there is no way around paying the $12 required to send scores. Consider these factors when using your free score sends."

        "Question": "What schools are generous with financial aid? Is financial aid the only way to afford a US education?",
        "Answer": "This is by far the most frequent question intl2USA receives. Unless you can pay the average cost of education in the US (usually $60,000 to $80,000 per year for 4 years), you will most likely need to apply for financial aid. \n\nHere in this document (all hail Ben Stern) you will find schools that will give you significant amount of financial aid if you do get admitted: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ekflwbvimx75ro/2019IvyAchievementIntlGuide-15-October-2018.pdf?dl=0 \n\nIf you are still unsure about a school meeting your demonstrated need check out its website. If they claim to meet full need they will, although the competition will be stiff"

        "Question": "What is CSS Profile?",
        "Answer": "The CSS is an online application to determine eligibility for non-federal financial aid, which is administered by the College Board, creator of the SAT®. Not every college requires it, but nearly 400 colleges do, so be sure to first check the list of schools to determine whether your child needs to complete the application. It's also important to see if the school requires students of divorced parents to complete the additional Noncustodial PROFILE. \n\nUnlike the FAFSA, there is a fee to apply. The first application is $25 and reports to additional schools are $16 each. Fee waivers are granted to high-need students, generally for household incomes of $40,000 or less per year. \n\nHow should I fill in the CSS profile? \nNo two people have the same finances so talk to your parents candidly and make sure to include every source of income and answer every question on the CSS profile, such as tax forms and debt, honestly. \nLying on the CSS profile will lead to your degree and financial aid being cancelled."

        "Question": "What is ISFAA?",
        "Answer": "ISFAA is a free version of CSS but not all schools accept ISFAA so you need to email each school you’re applying to and ask whether they accept ISFAA. When asking for css fee waivers certain schools will allow you to send the ISFAA (Pomona, Dartmouth, Bennington, Swarthmore etc.)"

    {
        "Question": "What is a Certificate of Finance or COF form?",
        "Answer": "It’s the form required to issue your I-20, which is in turn needed to issue your student/F1 visa to study in the US. The form requires you to state that you have sufficient funds to study in the United States. \n\nFor the vast majority of schools, COF is only required after you get accepted so this is usually not a thing you have to worry about when you’re applying."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What documents do I need to submit when I apply for aid?",
        "Answer": "Schools will have a checklist that shows all the documents you need to submit to be considered for financial aid either in their portal or in IDOC (a platform to upload sensitive documents for college)."

    {
        "Question": "What is a need-blind school? Do need-aware colleges give aid?",
        "Answer": "Need blind schools don’t discriminate against an applicant based on their ability to pay(This DOES NOT mean that they meet your full demonstrated need). However, the number of need-blind schools for internationals is very low(HYPM, Amherst, NYU Abu Dhabi, Yale-NUS claim to be need-blind). Need aware schools do take into consideration the applicant’s ability to pay. The lower your EFC the lower are your chances of getting into need-aware schools. However, if you are admitted the university will in most cases meet your full demonstrated need."
